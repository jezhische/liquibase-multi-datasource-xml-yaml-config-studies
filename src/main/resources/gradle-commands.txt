gradle init         in the directory containing the POM - to create gradle configuration from the maven one

To make the Wrapper files available to other developers and execution environments youâ€™ll need to check them into version control.
By default the wrapper task picks the exact same Gradle version that was used to generate the Wrapper files.
gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.0.1-bin.zip
So:
gradle wrapper      generates the necessary Wrapper files in the project directory
But:
As it's explained above, to set the Gradle version the command could be:
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 6.0.1 --distribution-type all


gradle assemble     The assemble task runs only the tasks which are required to package our application
gradle build        The build task runs the tasks which are required to package our application AND runs automated tests.
                    (Both of these commands create the first-java-project.jar file to the build/libs directory.)
But: It is recommended to always execute a build with the Wrapper to ensure a reliable, controlled and standardized
execution of the build. So the command could be like follow:
gradlew.bat build
